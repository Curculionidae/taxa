## Dig deeper
Please contact us if you need extended access to the underlying data.<br>
<strong>TaxonPages</strong> is a frontend interface that displays data from <strong>TaxonWorks</strong>. 
It is designed to be more user-friendly, allowing you to explore and view the data 
safely without the risk of editing it by mistake.<br>
TaxonWorks itself offers a wide range of advanced filtering, reporting, and curatorial tools, 
and with a little guidance from our team, we can provide you access to these additional capabilities. 
<strong>TaxonPages</strong> is in active development to gradually incorporate more of this extended functionality, 
making it easier for all users to explore and interact with the data.

## Data
Data for these pages is collaboratively curated online in a [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks) project. All data behind this site served as JSON through calls to a [TaxonWorks API](https://api.taxonworks.org). You can follow along by using the Console of your browser to explore the Network tab. <br>
The foundation of the project was a database curated by Nikolai Yunakov using the 3i software. Later, the dataset was expanded as part of the Ukrainian Biodiversity Information Network. Since January 2023, it has migrated to TaxonWorks and is now managed as an international collaborative project.

Currently, the map does not show citations for distributional data. You can download the full dataset for each taxon (including citations) in [Darwin Core format (DwC)](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) by clicking the icon in the right above the map.

## Outlook
This catalog is a <strong>work in progress</strong>. So far, the effort has been dedicated to the subfamily <strong>Entiminae</strong>, where the taxonomical database is already quite complete.<br>
Currently, we are also migrating the <strong>World Catalogue of the Curculionidae: Lixinae: Cleonini</strong> by Massimo Meregalli into TaxonWorks.<br>
The general focus right now lies primarily on nomenclature and taxonomy. In paralell, we add information on distribution and depictions, especially for type specimens. In the long run, it is also planned to provide host plant associations and morphological data.

## Technical
Want to create your own site? This website is built completely on open-source software. There is a [site template](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonpages) with more information. Data are curated in a [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks.org) project then shared via a [TaxonWorks API](https://api.taxonworks.org). Come [chat](https://gitter.im/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks) with the TaxonWorks community at any time.
